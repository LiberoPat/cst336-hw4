        <h2>What is Scrum</h2>
        <p>Scrum is an agile way to manage a software project. Rather than a succinct methodology, 
            scrum is rather a way to view and manage a process. <br>There is not a team leader in scrum who dictates everyone's role,
            rather, every team member works cross functionally. Another feature of scrum is <b>sprint</b>,<br> which is the scrum synonym
            of no more than a month taking an idea, to a programmed function to be tested, eventually sent in to be a feature or added to a <br>system. </p>
            
        <p>There are short daily meetings where each member of the scrum team discusses what they<br>
            have worked on, what they will work on today and then the next day. </p>
            
        <p>At the end of a sprint, the team demonstrates some new functionality that they come up <br>
            with to stakeholders, and then the team reflects on improving for next time. </p>
