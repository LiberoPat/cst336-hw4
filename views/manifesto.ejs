    <p>The <cite>Agile Manifesto</cite> is comprised of 4 key values, and 12 principles,<br> extablished by 17
    Agile Alliance developers in February, 2011

    <p>The Agile process was established to improve upon the methodologies<br>
        in software development. The traditional way prior to agile, accoding to the <br>
        was "cumbersome, unresponsive, and too much focus on documentation <br>requirements".
        There are various approaches to agile, one we will focus on is<br> called scrum.<br><br>
        The traditional way of going about software development<br> utilized the trickle down
        approach, where work is distributed in a team like<br> a sequenced relay. This is an
        ideal approach when the workflow is predictable.</p>
    <p>Agile is advantageous when there are roadblocks in the process, where many <br>revisions
        are expected.</p>
